      The model has a central position in a Play! application. It is the domain-specific  representation of the information on which the application operates.
      Martin fowler defines it as:
      Responsible for representing concepts of the business, information about the  business situation, and business rules. State that reflects the business situation  is controlled and used here, even though the technical details of storing it are  delegated to the infrastructure. This layer is the heart of business software.

      A Play! application follows the MVC architectural pattern as applied to the  architecture of the Web.
      This pattern splits the application into separate layers: the Presentation  layer and the Model layer. The Presentation layer is further split into a  View and a Controller layer.
